# wordle-clone-react

A clone for the well-known Wordle game developed with react. In this version I took away the one word per day limit, so it's possible to play as much as you can.

For getting the words I'm using the random-word from rapidapi. There's no input validation of the word, since sometimes the dictionaries that I found with api access return false a valid word generated with the random-word.

The game is saved after every attempt into the local storage of the devices, same with the stats info.

I would like to add this verification in a better way in the future, as well the dark version.
